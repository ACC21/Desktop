  abstract = {Sequence analysis is a major area in bioinformatics encompassing the
	methods and techniques for studying the biological sequences, DNA,
	RNA, and proteins, on the linear structure level. The focus of this
	area is generally on the identification of intra– and inter–molecular
	similarities. Identifying intra–molecular similarities boils down
	to detecting repeated segments within a given sequence, while identifying
	inter–molecular similarities amounts to spotting common segments
	among two or multiple sequences. From a data mining point of view,
	sequence analysis is nothing but string- or pattern mining specific
	to biological strings. For a long time, this point of view, however,
	has not been explicitly embraced neither in the data mining nor in
	the sequence analysis text books, which may be attributed to the
	co-evolution of the two apparently independent fields. In other words,
	although the word data-mining is almost missing in the sequence analysis
	literature, its basic concepts have been implicitly applied. Interestingly,
	recent research in biological sequence analysis introduced efficient
	solutions to many problems in data mining, such as querying and analyzing
	time series [49,53], extracting information from web pages [20],
	fighting spam mails [50], detecting plagiarism [22], and spotting
	duplications in software systems [14].},
